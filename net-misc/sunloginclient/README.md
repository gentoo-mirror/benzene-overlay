# Note for sunloginclient
 This ebuild is mostly converted from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sunloginclient). When run on the system with systemd init, the newest version runs without any problem(might need running `xhost +` before remote controlling). While on other systems with non-systemd init, **remote controling FROM others may not work, as the newest version depends on libsystemd.so**. While the older one **`10.0.2.24779`** runs without any problem. You can either just use the older version or just cp `libsystemd.so*` from other system to your lib64 directory (e.g.: `/usr/local/lib64`, and perhaps needs running `ldconfig -v`)
