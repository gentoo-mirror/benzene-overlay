# Note for sunloginclient
 This ebuild is mostly converted from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sunloginclient). On Arch Linux and Gentoo+Systemd it runs without any problem(might need running `xhost +` before remote controlling). On Gentoo with **OpenRC+elogind** , you can remote control other computer via Sunlogin, **but you CANNOT REMOTE CONTROL GENTOO FROM OTHERS**. Still no idea what cause this. **CAN ANYBODY HELP ME** ?
