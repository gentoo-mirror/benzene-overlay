# Note for sunloginclient
 This ebuild is mostly converted from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sunloginclient). On Arch Linux and Gentoo+Systemd, the newest version runs without any problem(might need running `xhost +` before remote controlling). On Gentoo with **OpenRC+elogind** , you can remote control other computer via the newest version, **but you cannot remote control Gentoo FROM others**. While the older one **`10.0.2.24779`** runs without any problem. Still no idea what cause this. **CAN ANYBODY HELP ME** ?
