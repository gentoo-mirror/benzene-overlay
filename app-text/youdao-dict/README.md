# Note for youdao-dict
This ebuild is mostly converted from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/youdao-dict). While on Arch Linux it runs without any problem, on Gentoo I have to [patch](https://github.com/Universebenzene/benzene-overlay/blob/master/dev-qt/qtwebkit/files/qtwebkit-5.212.0_pre20200309-position.patch) the qtwebkit to make it work. No idea why I have to do this yet.
