		The mpl-scatter-density mini-package provides functionality to make it easy to make
		your own scatter density maps, both for interactive and non-interactive use. Fast.
		The following animation shows real-time interactive use with 10 million points, but
		interactive performance is still good even with 100 million points (and more if you
		have enough RAM).
