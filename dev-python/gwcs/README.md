# Note for gwcs
Haven't updated gwcs here to the newest version yet, for newer versions need astropy-helpers > 3.2 (0.12.0 even needs astropy > 4.0).

If you still want the newest version, try [this overlay](https://github.com/Universebenzene/benzene-testlay/) instead, while tthose versions there are even less tested.
