		Sherpa is a modeling and fitting application for Python. It contains a
		powerful language for combining simple models into complex expressions
		that can be fit to the data using a variety of statistics and optimization
		methods. It is easily extensible to include user models, statistics, and
		optimization methods. It provides a high-level User Interface for interactive
		data-analysis work, such as within a Jupyter notebook, and it can also be
		used as a library component, providing fitting and modeling capabilities
		to an application.
